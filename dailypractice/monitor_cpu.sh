# Write a script that continuously monitors CPU usage. If the CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 70%), log the event to a file. 

# Output Example: 

# $ ./monitor_cpu.sh
# Monitoring CPU usage...
# CPU usage: 75% (Threshold exceeded)
# Logging event to 'cpu_usage_log.txt'...
# The log file cpu_usage_log.txt might look like this:

# [2024-08-22 10:15:30] CPU usage exceeded threshold: 75%
