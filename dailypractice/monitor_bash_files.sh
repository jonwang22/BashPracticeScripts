# Write a script to monitor the whole system for new bash files and when they are detected make them executable for the current user and let the user know.

# Output Example:

# $ ./monitor_bash_files.sh
# New bash file detected: /path/to/script.sh
# Making the file executable for the current user...
# File '/path/to/script.sh' is now executable.
# $ ./monitor_bash_files.sh
# No new bash files detected.
