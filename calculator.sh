### You have been tasked with creating a basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will take two integer inputs from the user and then ask the user which operation they would like to perform. Based on the user's choice, the script will perform the corresponding operation and display the result.

### If you finish quickly, make sure to think of ways to optimize your script.  Itâ€™s one thing for things to go right, but what happens when things go wrong ;)


#!/bin/bash

# We need to prompt the user to enter 2 integers.
# We need to prompt the user to choose an operation: +,-,*,/
# Use conditionals (if, elif, else) to perform the chosen operation.
# Display the result of the operation.
# Handle division by zero with an appropriate error message.
